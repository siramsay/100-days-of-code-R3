# Round 3 /  100 Days Of Code - Log
For this Round I decided to start my own log instead of forking the 100 day of code repository. The reason is I didn't really need to get updates to the master which happens when you have forked a repository.
I wanted to use this repo to track my progress my registering my work as a commit.

### Day 180 2021 May 13, Thursday

**Today's Progress**

*3D cube Library*
1. Look at the possibility of making more than one cube of each type with different dimensions.

**Thoughts**
- The idea is not possible as is because the variables aren't able to be scoped. i.e. if you change --depth it changes all elements. 
- With JavaScript and inline styles you could be it.
- Generating all the classes and making it shakable could work.
- A preprocessor could work.
