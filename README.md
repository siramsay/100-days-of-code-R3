# Round 3 /  100 Days Of Code - Log
For this Round I decided to start my own log instead of forking the 100 day of code repository. The reason is I didn't really need to get updates to the master which happens when you have forked a repository.
I wanted to use this repo to track my progress my registering my work as a commit.

### Day 136 2021 March 30, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**

*Weather Feed on niseko snow*
1. Write (Pseudo) code to hide the table columns for previous timeframes. Only leave one old timeframe.
2. Test code and push to all rows. Add CSS to hide columns and then remove until next step is worked out.
3. Pseudo code to fix table day/date header, e.g. Mon 29 Mar need to be hidden if before 9 and also colspan needs to be adjusted.
4. Write and test code for day/date header and prep. Pseudocode in dev note book.

**Thoughts:**
* Edge case where fetch at 9:00AM fails will cause this solution to fail. Maybe write a test/ function to record this event. 
* The display as such won't fail as data is cached, the switch statement will just reset to the previous day.
